#HospitL Emergency Room Deshboard
##
I recently learned how to design an interactive dashboard and analyze real-world healthcare data—and this Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard is the result!

Through this project, I explored how data can support better decision-making in critical environments like emergency care. Here’s what I analyzed:

🔹 Patient Admission Status – Visualized how many patients were admitted vs. not admitted
🔹 Patient Age Distribution – Grouped patients by age to understand demographic trends
🔹 Timeliness of Care – Measured the percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes
🔹 Gender Analysis – Compared patient counts by gender
🔹 Department Referrals – Identified which departments received the most referrals

This dashboard helped me strengthen my skills in:
✔️ Data analysis
✔️ Dashboard design
✔️ Data storytelling
✔️ Turning raw data into meaningful insights

Excited to keep learning and building more data-driven solutions! 🚀
Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
